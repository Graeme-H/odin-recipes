    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Move the oven rack to the center 
        position.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
    <p>Combine bread crumbs, garlic, rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a 
    small bowl; stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil to moisten the mixture. Set aside.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
   <p> Season rack of lamb all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons 
    olive oil in a large heavy oven-proof skillet over high heat. Add lamb and sear on all sides, 
    about 1 to 2 minutes: set lamb aside for a few minutes. Brush lamb with mustard and roll in 
    bread crumb mixture until evenly coated. Cover the ends of the bones with foil to prevent 
    charring.</p>S
    <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
    <p>Arrange the breaded rack of lamb bone-side down in the same skillet. Roast in preheated oven 
    for 12 to 18 minutes for medium; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should 
    read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C), or continue to cook to desired doneness. Remove 
    lamb from the skillet and allow to rest for 5 to 7 minutes, loosely covered with foil, before 
    carving between the ribs.</p>
