                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
               
                <ul>
                    <li>1 (16 ounce) package pork sausage meat or ground pork</li>
                    <li>1 (17.25 ounce) package frozen puff pastry sheets, thawed</li>
                    <li>Â¼ cup Dijon mustard</li>
                    <li>1 beaten egg</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>Directions</h2>

                <h4>Step 1</h4>
                 <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p>  

                 <h4>Step 2</h4>
                 <p>Unfold puff pastry sheets and cut along the fold lines of each sheet to form
                     6 equal squares for a total of 12 squares. Brush each square with mustard. 
                     Divide sausage into 12 pieces and roll into small logs. Place one log on 
                     each square. Roll dough around the sausage, and seal with a bit of 
                     beaten egg. Place rolls onto an ungreased baking sheet, and brush the tops 
                     with the rest of the egg.</p>

                <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven until the rolls are puffed and golden, about 20 minutes.
                     I usually watch after 10 minutes or so to make sure they don't burn.</p>
